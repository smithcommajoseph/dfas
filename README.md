# DFAs

I have found myself writing a small handful of DFAs (definite finite automata). The requirements differed from project to project. For example, the C implementation takes input and has the ability to saves/write values whereas the Haskell and Prolog versions are quite a bit simpler. Each version has comments containing basic instructions included in the file as well as sample test values one may try out.
